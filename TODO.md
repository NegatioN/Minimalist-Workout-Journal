# Things to improve

1. Persist exercises in a database, and let mappings interact explicitly with this.
2. Allow pure json-input, bypass simplified input
3. Allow input of date as a user-specified parameter in simple-version.
4. Maybe there should be a rating or comment associated with the workout, as this is common for other workout-logs.
